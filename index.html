        <h1>Introduction</h1>
      </header>
      <p>This is my technical document page in learning CSS and HTML. I really need to improve my coding with practice and focus so one day I can land a job in this field. So far I've been working in construction and I don't enjoy the idea that I
        might get stuck doing that for the rest of my life, it's a very physically straining job. I want to learn new things and feel challenged daily with coding and problem solving. I took interest in computers at a young age, unfortunately my
        family struggled financially, I had to put it to the side until I got a job. When I was able to splurg a bit I bought my CPU first, then my motherboard, and before I knew it I hooked up my graphic's card and uploaded Windows with a Youtubed
        usb bootdrive. After finding out and seeing web developers online, and in communities succeed and showoff their skills as self taught software engineers, it led me to search up more and more stories and content on this field. I want to be in
        one of those stories and tell people they can achieve their goals.</p>

        <h1>Learning Path</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Sharks have to constently swim to stay alive, otherwise water won't pump through their gills to breathe. Similarly, software engineers have to contantly learn everyday and develop new skills otherwise they won't be able to keep up with new
        software technology.</p>
      <p><code>I want to start off a new career as a frontend web developer. To achieve this I need to:</code></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Have HTML and CSS become second nature.</li>
        <li>Learn and become comfortable with Javascript.</li>
        <li>Use and keep on learning Python.</li>
        <li>Get familiar with Data Structures and Algorithms.</li>
        <li>Practice daily, make coding a nice routine (e.g Codewars).</li>
        <li>Final, Interview prep.</li>
      </ol>

        <h1>Road Blocks</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Learning code is not an easy thing to do, theirs a reason why developers are paid what they're paid.</p>

        <li>Losing interest/not going through with it.</li>

        <li>Being scared of going with it and failing.</li>

        <h1>Strategies</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Theirs always something that has provokes someone to deter from their main goal. Everyday after work, until I feel comfortable enough applying for jobs, I will code until I need to go to sleep.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Getting through all of FreeCodeCamp.</li>
        <li>Studing data structures and algorithms daily. (Perferrably after learning Javascript)</li>

      <p>Construction work is brutal, its also unhealthy, and it takes a big toll on ones body. Thats why my top goal and motivation is to get a better job.</p>
